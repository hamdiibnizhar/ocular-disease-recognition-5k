This is project for classify ocular disease with Ocular Disease Recognition-5K (ODIR-5K) Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k
in this repository recognize the case using VGG-like architecture with 2 strategies:
   1. Multi-Class Classification - validation result with : Accuracy: 90.04%   | F1-Score: 88.10%   | Kappa: 86.16% | AUC: 99.16%
   2. Multi-Label Classification - validation result with : Accuracy: 89.65%   | F1-Score (Top-5): 50.17% | AUC: 80.12%
   


the deployment in android is in [android-deployment](https://github.com/hamdiibnizhar/ocular-disease-recognition-5k/blob/master/android-deployment) folder
